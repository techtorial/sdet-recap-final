    POSSIBLE INTERVIEW QUESTIONS:

    1-What is polymorphism?

    -->It means many forms. It is a different forms of the object (Poly-->many   morphism-->forms)

    AUTOMATION: WEBDRIVER DRIVER =NEW CHROMEDRIVER();  -->40 methods   List<String> numbers=new ArrayList()
                CHROMEDRIVER DRIVER =NEW CHROMEDRIVER(); -->35         ArrayList<String> numbers=new ArrayList()

    2-What is the difference between overloading and overriding ? **(THE MOST COMMON QUESTION)

    OVERLOADING:
    -->public void overloading(int a) //method signature
    -->private void overloading(int a, String b)
    -->Overloading needs to happen in same class
    -->Overloading can have private,final,static keyword

    ***It checks the method signature only (name of the method + parameters)
    **It doesnt care about return type and access modifiers

    OVERRIDDING:
    -->Overriding needs to happen in different class(Extend or Implement keywords to make connections)
    -->Overridding cannot have private,static or final keyword.
    -->Overridding should have same method signature (Access modifiers can be same or more accessible) + Return type

    3-What is dynamic and static polymorphism?

        Dynamic -->action
        static -->stable(there is not too much actions)

        overloading   public void eat(int a )    public void eat(int a, int b) -->STATIC

        overriding   --->MORE ACTIONS --> DYNAMIC
